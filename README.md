# OrribleRM
A very simple and primitive ORM, create SQL code FROM C# code

How to use it:

1) Create model class in "Model" folder
2) Open "Program.cs" class and create a new object of this class. (for example i created User Object)
3) Pass the object in SqlWriterEntity instance of class.
4) rum the project
5)you will find the "converted" file in generatedSql folder.

Thanks.
